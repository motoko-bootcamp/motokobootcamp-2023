Welcome to all **Moto-campers** üëã <br/>

We're excited to share with you the incredible capabilities of the Internet Computer, a network that brings together various fields including cryptography, mathematics, computer science, and blockchain technology.

But beyond the technology itself, the most important aspect of the Internet Computer is the community of passionate individuals who believe in its potential. At this Bootcamp, you'll have the opportunity to learn from a diverse group of developer mentors, organizers, and contributors who are volunteering their time to make this event possible and amazing.

Our goal is to transmit not only our technical knowledge but also our enthusiasm for the Internet Computer and its role in shaping a better future. We believe that blockchain technology and the Internet Computer will play a key role in creating a more fair and hopeful world, and we hope that the knowledge you gain and the connections you'll create during this week will help us work towards this goal.

Each event contains a Zoom Webinar join URL, and if necessary there are also options to call in for audio (though we recommend using the join URL).

Each lecture will be recorded and available on Discord so you can keep up even if you are not available to watch it live.

# üß© Lessons 
Each day you will find a module. Each module is dedicated to explain and details a specific aspect about building a project on the Internet Computer (project stucture, configuration, cycle management, upgrades...). 

You don't have any action to take regarding modules - expect to read them all!

# üôã Questions  
Questions are designed to test your understanding of the subjects covered in the lectures or explained in the module. 
There will be a few questions for you each day, and you will have **48 hours** after the daily guide is published to submit your answers. 
Some of the answers may be provided directly during the lectures, while others may require you to delve deeper into the material and make use of the resources provided in the (#usef) section. 
It is recommended to spend between **30 minutes** and **1 hour** each day working on the questions to reinforce your learning and deepen your knowledge of the material.

# ü•ä Coding challenges 
Coding challenges are designed to help you become familiar with the Motoko language through practice. 
There will be a few coding challenges for you each and you will have **48 hours** after the daily guide is published to submit your answers. 
It is recommended to spend between **30 minutes and 1 hour** each day working on the coding challenges. These challenges are a helpful way to build your skills and confidence with Motoko as you progress through the Bootcamp.

# üßπ  Tasks 
Tasks are designed to guide you through your core project. 
Each day (expect on Day 1) you will receive **1 task** that corresponds to the implementation of one or more features of your core project. 

# üîó Useful links 
A list of useful resources, such as websites, documentation, and sample code, related to the topics of the day will be provided. These resources may be required for some questions, coding challenges, or tasks.

# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Core project 
The core project is a project that you will build during the entire week. 
The experience of building this project will be as close as possible as what the experience of building a real-live project on the Internet Computer looks like. <br/>
All information related to the core project can be found in **[this document](core_project/PROJECT.MD)**. The core project submission form will be made available on day 7.

# üê• Open mentorship hours 
Throughout the week there are some Open Dev Mentor Hours scheduled, you should have at least 2 within your time zone. <br/>
These meetings will be the opportunity for all students to troubleshoot issues live and ask questions directly with a dev mentor. <br/>
This is open to everyone participating in the Bootcamp. <br/> It is highly recommended you attend at least one of these (or watch the recordings), even if you don't have any specific issues.

# ü´Ç Team meetings  
Motoko Bootcamp is a self-driven event where each student works on their project individually, but it can still be helpful to have other students who can share your journey and help **motivate** you to stay on track.

Each student will be assigned a team of around 10 students within a similar time zone, and then get private voice & chat channels on Discord where they can get together and discuss progress. We encourage each team to schedule a time each day to meet on the Discord voice channel to stay in touch.

# ü§π Activities 
We have several activities planned throughout the week to help you connect with your fellow students and take a break from coding. 
These activities include:

- **Networking session**: these sessions are designed to help you connect with other students and build relationships that may be beneficial to you in the future. Whether you're looking to make new friends, find a study buddy, or network for job opportunities, these sessions are a great way to make connections. More information on [üåènetworking](https://discord.gg/TCYkvax6)
- **Talks**: We will host talks to discuss about the IC ecosystem. This is a great opportunity to learn and gain insights into the space. We will announce these on Discord, so keep an eye out for them!
- **Game sessions**: Taking breaks is important for maintaining productivity and mental well-being, so we recommend scheduling at least 2 gaming sessions for your team so you can relax and have fun with your classmates. Use your team's Discord voice channel to share live audio during your gaming session, and have fun!

# üìû Assistance & Troubleshooting
This event is being run by volunteers and we have **limited** resources, we won't be able to answer all questions at all times considering that we have hundreds of students, please understand this fact and make sure to follow **all instructions** in the **order** provided.

When you need help, follow these steps **in this order**:

1) Search on **Google**: most issues have their solution somewhere on the Internet, this is how real developers solve most of their problems. You need to make sure you've searched for a few minutes on the Internet before moving to the **next step**. <br/>
2) Dig into the list of resources and documentation at the bottom of this guide. Most likely the answer you need will be in here if you dig enough, and the more practice you get navigating these resources the more effective and self-sufficient you'll be able to be as an Internet Computer developer.
3) Ask your **team** for help on **Discord**: you all have been assigned a specific team channel on Discord, this team is composed of people in your Time zone who are learning along with you. If you run into an issue, someone in your group probably encountered the same issue and might have the solution. You need to make sure you've asked your team and waited for a few minutes before moving to the **next step**. <br/>
4) Go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/936722757692047470/1045691044387373076" target="_blank"> #ask-questions </a> channel on Discord and ask your question by creating a new topic. **Make sure** your issue hasn't already been answered in another topic. <br/> If you decide to create a new topic, please provide as much information as possible:
- When did you encounter the issue?
- What is the exact error message?
- What have you already tried to deal with the problem? 
- **Provide some screenshots** to illustrate your request.

Note: your issue might be resolved only in the next mentor session if we need you to share your screen and the issue cannot be resolved in one simple answer.

> üö´ Do not **spam** the main channel of Discord with your issue, and do **not** directly **DM** mentors. Disruptive behavior that hinders the learning of other students will put you at risk of getting kicked out of the Bootcamp. We've never had to do this before, don't be the first.

# üéì Graduation levels
- **Graduated** | You submitted a core project that met the requirements. 
- **Graduated with honors** | You submitted a core project that met the requirements, and went above and beyond by also meeting the graduate with honors requirements [described in the core project guide](core_project/PROJECT.MD).
- **Graduated at top of your class** | You submitted a core project which included unique extra features beyond any requirements we provided, and the dev mentors found your submission exceptional.
- **Top 3** | 3 students will have the honor of being judged as having the 3 most impressive submissions.

# üéÅ Prizes 
All Motoko-Bootcamp **graduates** will receive :

- A **non-transferrable NFT-diploma** that will give special access to an exclusive Motoko Bootcamp **<a href="https://dscvr.one/p/motoko-bootcamp" target="\_blank"> DSCVR </a>** portal where students will be able to continue learning and collaborating with mentors and other graduates. üèÜ

Motoko Bootcamp graduates will recieve a share of prizes from our prize pool. This includes some NFTs as well as up to 3,000,000 OGY tokens (worth $20k), depending on how many graduates we have. More details on prizes are coming soon.

The prizes are great, but keep in mind that this isn't a hackathon and the focus is education. The most valauble prize any student will get from then event (registered or enrolled) is the knowledge they gain!

> <strong> The gift of knowledge is the highest gift in the world. </strong>
